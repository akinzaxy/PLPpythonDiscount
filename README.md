# PLPpythonDiscount

calculate_discount function: It takes two parameters, price and discount_percent. If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, the function calculates the discount amount, subtracts it from the original price, and returns the final price. If the discount is less than 20%, it simply returns the original price.

User input: We prompt the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage, ensuring that both inputs are converted to floating-point numbers (float).

Final price calculation: The function is called with the user's input, and depending on whether the discount is applied, the final price is printed. If no discount is applied, it prints the original price.
